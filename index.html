                <h2>Overview</h2>

                <p>This is my Italy Travel Guide/Portfolio for my Creativity and Identity in Florence and Rome
                    (ENG290/HON300) class on the KIIS Italy Summer 2023 study abroad trip. The goal is to give an
                    overview of some of my better works and experiences on the trip. I've split these into Florence and
                    Rome sections. I have also included my food journal from my Italian Cuisine and Tourism (IDST350)
                    class.</p>
                <p>The assigned reading greatly helped shape the structure of this guide/portfolio. It includes pictures
                    that relate to the topics, poetry over the most mundane aspects of life, analyzation of the most
                    minute details in a work, and a guide-like narration over the city. All of these aspects of this
                    guide/portfolio were inspired by the readings we read over the course of our stay, and they
                    hopefully come together to make this a better piece of travel writing.</p>
                <p>To the left (or above on smaller screens) is a basic map that shows every city in Italy that I
                    visited on the trip. In order of
                    date traveled, they are: Florence, Monterosso al Mare, Pisa, Viareggio, Fiesole, Bologna, Venice,
                    Tivoli, Rome, and Santa Marinella</p>
                <p>Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy!</p>
