                <h4>The Dynamicity of Rome</h4>
            </div>

            <p>Rome is an extremely diverse city in every way. From the people to the architecture to the age of
                everything
                around, Rome truly is a dynamic city. One of the best examples of this, in my opinion, is the walk from
                Hotel Trastevere to the Colosseum. </p>

            <img src="../images/Rome/HotelTrastevere.png" alt="Hotel Trastevere">

            <p>We begin our journey at Hotel Trastevere, a small hotel just next to Piazza San Cosimato in the
                Trastevere
                neighborhood of Rome. It is a very Italian area with few tourists compared to the rest of the city.
                During
                the day, the piazza is home to produce vendors who are selling fresh fruits and vegetables for their
                neighbors to use in their meals for the day. During the afternoon and night, the piazza is the local
                hangout
                spot for the Italian teens who all just got out of school. Around the area, there are many small local
                restaurants and convenience stores littered around the blocks.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/Rome/Bridge.png" alt="Ponte Garibaldi Bridge">

            <p>The next large attraction of our walk is the Ponte Garibaldi bridge that crosses the Tiber River. Here is
                where we leave Trastevere and begin seeing more tourists. Build in the 1880s, the bridge is a beautiful
                feat
                of engineering that fits perfectly into the city, while still having its own personality. Unlike most
                other
                bridges around, here you find up to 4 lanes of busy traffic along with a full walkway on each side. The
                bridge acts not only as our bridge from Trastevere to the rest of Rome, but also as our bridge from the
                simpler, poorer, and more local areas to the eccentric, rich, and tourist-heavy heart of the city.</p>

            <img src="../images/Rome/Park.png" alt="Piazza Benedetto Cairoli">

            <p>Soon after crossing the bridge, you will come across the small Piazza Benedetto Cairoli. This little gem
                is
                filled with people hanging out, playing with their dogs, and enjoying the greenery (which is a rarity in
                the
                city). The piazza contrasts very well with the cityscape as trees line the perimeter, almost allowing
                you to
                forget you are in a large city for just a few moments. Around this point of the journey is where the
                small
                convenience stores and local restaurants begin to become souvenir stores and tourist trap restaurants.
                The
                prices go up and the waiters urge you to come eat, and it only gets worse as you go on.</p>

            <img src="../images/Rome/SmallRuins.png" alt="Largo di Torre Argentina">

            <p>Next we get to see our first ancient Roman ruins at the Largo di Torre Argentina. This small area was
                home to
                Pompey’s Theater and is believed to be where Julius Caesar was killed. The sight of this small area with
                significant history that is surrounded by the more modern city built up around it is an amazing sight to
                see. All around you are cars and buses speeding by and honking with crowds of people going in and out of
                stores and restaurants, but in the center of it all is the small, seemingly innocent ancient square
                where
                one of the most famous betrayals in history took place.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/Rome/AlterOfTheFatherland.png" alt="Altar of the
        Fatherland">

            <p>The next large sight is also an insanely important sight for Italian history. It is the Altar of the
                Fatherland, a large monument that was built from 1885 to 1935 to honor the first king of the unified
                Italy,
                Victor Emmanuel II. Going from the sight of the death of a former Roman leader in 44 BC to the monument
                of
                the first king of the unified Italy in 1861, about 1900 years later. It is an amazing way to see for
                yourself how old and dynamic Rome truly is with its layered past.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/Rome/Colosseum.png" alt="Colosseum">

            <p>Finally, you walk past the Roman forum and up to the Colosseum. All along the way, what were once local
                stops
                have become nothing but tourists traps, cheap souvenirs, and street vendors. Meanwhile, you’ve seen the
                true
                Italian lifestyle turn into modern life, into ancient history, into more recent history, and into
                ancient
                history again. However, don’t be fooled, surrounding the history in one area is always buildings or
                objects
                from another time. That can be seen not only at the location of Caesar’s death, but also at the
                Colosseum,
                which is surrounded by more modern homes, hotels, and restaurants. This walk truly is the best way to
                experience the dynamicness of Rome with its layered history. Rome really does have a story to tell in
                each
                turn.

                    <h4>Context</h5>
                        <p>This was my work for the second project of the class. The assignment was to create a creative
                            writing
                            piece that shows the dynamism of Rome with its mix of ancient ruins and modern shops and
                            architecture,
                            beauty and decay, quiet and noisy spaces, wealth and poverty, stone and greenery, and
                            everything
                            else
                            that is similar. I
                            chose the walk from our hotel to the Colosseum because during this time each of the
                            previously
                            mentioned
                            contrasts are on display. To add a bit of creative writing to the piece, I tried to write as
                            some
                            sort
                            of tour guide who is pointing out all of these contrasting things as we are walking along.
