                <p>The La Firenze is a sandwich consisting of Tuscan ham, Tuscan pecorino, truffle cream, fresh
                    tomatoes, and rocket salad. It was a very large sandwich for the price and was extremely filling.
                    The bread was crispy and dry, but the rest of the ingredients made up for it. The flavors of the
                    ham, cheese, and cream came together and blended surprisingly well and unless you really tried, it
                    was difficult to distinguish between the tastes of the different ingredients. In all, it made for a
                    great lunch that wasn't too small but was still light.</p>

                <p>The lasagna at Ristorante Boccadama is their self proclaimed house specialty and it definitely does
                    not disappoint. The pasta was extremely tender and had a melt in your mouth texture that paired
                    perfectly with the flavor. The lasagna was served at the perfect temperature and was clearly made to
                    order. The beef used also had a good flavor and could've stood as a solid dish without the pasta.
                    The only downside was that it did not pair well with the house wine, however, that is more of a
                    knock on the wine as it was not the greatest itself. I would definitely recommend this meal as a
                    dinner option.</p>

                <p>The Quattro Stagioni pizza consisted of cooked ham, mushrooms, artichokes, and olives on tomato sauce
                    with some mozzarella cheese on top. The name of the pizza, which means "four seasons" in English, is
                    very telling of the type of dish this pizza is because each topping makes the pizza feel entirely
                    different. Also, each topping had mostly its own slice so it was almost like eating a slice of four
                    separate pizzas. The ham slice had the familiar and almost American-style pizza taste. The mushroom
                    was a bit softer but gave its slice a meat-like flavor. The artichoke slice was full of artichokes
                    that burst in your mouth. These sudden bursts of flavor did not pair well with the pizza and
                    ultimately, I do not believe artichoke should be a pizza topping. Finally, the olive slice was
                    surprisingly tasty. The colder, sweeter olives paired well with the pizza. In all, the pizza made
                    for a decent lunch, however, I do not believe it was good when compared to other pizzas.</p>

                    bar and it did not disappoint. The burger was easily the size of 2 and was topped with triplo pane,
                    pecorino, insalata, pomodoro, chedar, due anelli di cipolla fritti, bacon, and salsa della casa. All
                    of these flavors blended together excellently and were the perfect taste of home with an Italian
                    twist. It also paired amazingly with their Hildegard beer. The burger was cooked between medium and
                    medium well which made it perfectly tender. It is definitely a must try for any hungry traveler.

                    American McDonald's. Even the french fries and Sprite I had with it were unchanged. The only
                    noticeable difference was that the burger patty was a normal beef color instead of the typical
                    greyish brown you see in America. Overall, the taste and texture were that of your typical cheap
                    McDonald's Big Mac and there is not much else to note. It's a great option for anyone feeling a bit

                <p>The Florentine steak is a classic dish famous in Florence and it does not disappoint. The steak I had
                    was cooked medium rare (the standard), but it had the tenderness of a medium or medium-well steak
                    without the chewiness of a rarer steak. The salt crystals sprinkled about gave some bites more
                    flavor and a slightly different texture than the rest because the crystals were relatively large.
                    The steak was seasoned in a way that compliments the typical meat taste instead of attempting to
                    drown it out, which is a mistake many smaller steakhouses make in America. The steak was also
                    massive (0.7 - 1.0 kg) and could easily feed two. Overall, it was a nice meal. Very well-suited for
                    a fancier night out or possibly a date as long as you are comfortable with the bloodiness of a rarer
                    steak.</p>

                    from the picture, the bread has an interesting design that almost looks like a large slice of swiss
                    cheese. The sandwich was server cold and if you have ever had a turkey sandwich, you've had this
                    sandwich. The lemonade paired well with it and was actually the most interesting part of the meal.
                    The lemonade was not like American lemonade, but it was actually more like a fresh squeezed lemon
                    juice with extra pulp. Extremely sour, yet also very satisfying and thirst quenching in the midday
                    heat.</p>

                    tell, this pizza is closer in style to a typical American pizza than the previous one mentioned. I
                    am typically not a huge fan of onion, however, onion definitely belonged on this pizza because the
                    pairing of the tastes of the onion and the sausage was nearly perfect. In addition, the evenly
                    dispersed cheese was perfectly milky, and chunks of tomato made each bite unique, which is exactly
                    what Italian dishes attempt to be. It perfectly accomplishes the task of making an Americanized dish
                    in the Italian style for all the hungry tourist who had just had a long beach day.</p>

                    never has never seen a hotdog went and made one from a verbal description. The hotdog was served on
                    a sub-style piece of bread. The hotdog itself was cut in half and laid on the bread. Then, the
                    ketchup was applied like a condiment would be on a sub. Outside of the hotdog being barely warm, the
                    bread being slightly stale, and the ketchup drowning any chance of taste; it was a decent lunch.
                    Nothing to write home about, but still alright. The taste was mostly just ketchup and any small
                    taste of hotdog can be described as the taste of any precooked frozen hotdog. A great lunch for the
                    tourist heavy environment around the Leaning Tower area. You definitely get what you pay for.</p>

                <p>This spaghettoni was the most interesting and different dish I've had so far. It is exclusively on
                    the Spring-Summer menu at Tamerò and it was unlike any seafood dish I've had before. Instead of your
                    traditional meat sauce, the spaghettoni was made with a mussel sauce. This gave the dish a more
                    fishy smell than the pasta I am used to. It also had an almost shrimp like taste, however, that is
                    all I can describe it as because I am not familiar with the taste of mussels. The spaghettoni was
                    quite thick, so it did not retain its sauce as well as you would like when it was picked up with a
                    fork. The texture of the dish was slightly more chewy than a spaghetti with meat sauce. This was
                    partially due to the larger type of pasta and partially due to the use of seafood. Overall, it was a
                    decent dish that anyone should try at least once, but personally, I will stick to land based meats
                    in my pasta.</p>

                    I've had, and overall tasted like a frozen lasagna that had been reheated in the oven. The dish
                    lacked much cheese that wasn't baked on and it was surprisingly difficult to cut with a fork.
                    Despite all this, it had a good flavor and texture that is very reminiscent of a "fast food" style
                    lasagna that you would find at a place like Fazoli's. With it having such a cheap price point, it
                    was definitely worth its cost and is a good lunch option for a quick and cheap meal when you are out

                    mouth feel that anyone would want in a pasta. The ragu and cheese blended together amazingly to
                    create a lasagna with a perfect creamy filling between each layer of fresh pasta. The tagliatelle
                    was the perfect side dish. The longer and thicker noodles of the tagliatelle offered a simpler
                    flavor palate when compared to the lasagna, which was the perfect combination for a meal in Italy. I
                    may be a little biased since I made it, but I believe this may be the best lasagna I've had and
                    maybe will ever have in Italy.</p>

                <p>This sandwich from Piccadilly is quite a mysterious sandwich. On the menu is is labeled as
                    "Schiacciate" which is just the type of bread it is served on and the meat on the sandwich could
                    easily be either roast beef or lampredotto (meat from a cow stomach). I am leaning towards the
                    latter, however, it was a good meal either way. The sandwich was extremely simple, consisting of
                    only bread and the meat. The bread was toasted to the point of near inedibility and tasted very
                    similar to a white bread toast that was just extremely tough to bite into. The meat, on the other
                    hand, had an extremely good taste and texture. Its taste had a slight spice to it, almost as if it
                    had been marinating prior to being cooked and it had the texture of a higher quality lunch meat that
                    wasn't chewy or thin but is still tender. If you were to remove the bread from the sandwich and eat
                    the meat on its own or if the bread were just not toasted, it could have been one of the better
                    sandwiches I've had in town. Regardless, it still made for a decent lunch when paired with an Aperol

                <p>The Crispy Golocious burger was a 200g meat patty with classic cheddar cheese, white cheddar cheese,
                    bacon, and their "Crispy" sauce. To put it simply, it was one of the best burgers I've had. Each
                    topping/condiment worked to compliment the flavor of the meat instead of do its own thing. The meat
                    itself was your classic beef patty seasoned with something similar to a steak's seasoning. The meat
                    was clearly never frozen and it was noticeable that they took their time cooking it instead of
                    rushing it because the patty was perfectly tender and was neither tough nor chewy. The cheeses were
                    stringy when bitten into which gave the burger a unique eating experience. The bacon was also
                    perfect as it gave the burger patty a greasier, fattier counterpart to contribute to each bite.
                    Finally, the "Crispy" sauce was one of the best house sauces I've tried. It is comparable to
                    In-N-Out's famous burger sauce in taste and similarly, the "Crispy" sauce works to add a slight
                    sweetness to the burger and does not oversaturate the overall taste. Overall, this burger was
                    amazing and is the perfect break from the constant meals of pasta.</p>

                <p>This sandwich was from a small shop at one of Bologna's farmers markets. It consisted of grilled
                    chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mustard mayonnaise on a folded piece of flatbread. Overall, it
                    was a solid light lunch. The chicken was tender and not chewy. The bacon had an odd amount of spicy
                    to it that really helped the sandwich taste complete. The veggies and condiment gave the sandwich
                    more definition, made it less dry, and gave it a much healthier feeling. The biggest plus was the
                    bread. It was an extremely nice break from the hard, terrible Tuscan bread. This bread was soft with
                    a simple taste similar to the Artisan Flatbread at Subway. The only real downside to the sandwich
                    was that it wasn't very filling.</p>

                    It tasted like the KFC chicken at home, but it was far less greasy. The potatoes here were much
                    better than the bland, cardboard potatoes back home. You could tell these were real potatoes that
                    were nearly fresh because they did not need the gravy to have a taste. Overall, it was a great meal
                    that was also cheap, quick, and not pasta. Plus they had free refills!</p>

                    reheated when I ordered. Outside of this, the only notable this is that the service was amazing. The

                <p>You can only eat so much pasta, so I tried an imitation American fast food joint. The burger
                    consisted of 3 patties, cheese, lettuce, pickle, tomato, ketchup, mayonnaise, and barbeque sauce all
                    on a sesame seed bun. Both the burger and fries are made fresh when you order, so the food actually
                    tastes and presents as very high quality compared to true American places like McDonald's. The
                    burger tastes very good. The flavors blend very nicely, and I am a huge fan of how the BBQ adds a
                    bit of tanginess to each bit and there is a noticeable lack of grease. Other than that, it is a
                    standard fast food burger.</p>

                    great. The truffle cream was a nice change of pace from ragu sauce. It was nice and smooth with an
                    almost soup like taste and texture. It could've used some sort of meat or a larger portion size for
                    the price, but it was still a good lunch.</p>

                    mozzarella based on the taste, stringiness, and color. The ham was your typical lunch meat style ham

                    made it taste almost like an American pizza (which I believe is superior so far). The crust was
                    difficult to eat in the sections without toppings because it was burnt, dry, and tough. The salami
                    was difficult to cut and just tore since I had only a dull butter knife. Outside of these small
                    issues, it was an amazing pizza. It was not too chewy nor did it fall apart very often, so I can't
                    complain at all. The taste was that of a typical meat lover's pizza.</p>

                    eat, but it did not fall apart. Often the breads here are either too stale to bite through or so
                    soft that they fall apart with the toppings, so this was a much needed experience. The texture was
                    slightly mushy in some spots, but similar to a bread loaf with cheese on it in others. It tasted
                    amazing. The cheeses came together with the spice of the sausage to make each bite an explosion of
                    flavor inside of a piece of bread. Overall, it was amazing and I will definitely be trying calzones

                    the time frame needed that looked decent. With that being said, it wasn't bad. The mushrooms added a
                    decent flavor at times, but tasted burnt at other times. The meal as a whole was less pizza and more
                    of a Cheesy Bread from Domino's that was made with mushrooms on top. It was 90% bread with a small
                    amount of cheese and mushroom. When you could taste anything other than bread, it was pretty good.

                    while its texture and flexibility was similar to Subway's Artisan Flatbread. The chicken was very
                    good. They were your typical boneless BBQ chicken wings, but with a lack of BBQ and chicken in my
                    diet lately, it was a nice feeling to eat. When eaten as a whole, the chicken overtakes the taste of
                    the bread, which I believe is good, but could be bad depending on the person. As a whole, it was a
                    great meal after a long day of travel. </p>

                    with tomato, lettuce, cheddar, and mozzarella cheese. It was also served with fries on a shovel
                    instead of a plate, which was a nice touch. The burger was large, smelt like any good burger, and
                    the toppings all came together to form an amazing taste. The thing that really stood out, though,
                    was the texture of the beef patty. It felt like pulled pork with the taste of beef instead of the
                    typical ground beef patty texture. It made for a very unique eating experience that I would
                    definitely try again.</p>

                <p>I don't think that there is a bad burger in Italy. The Say Cheeeeeese Burger at Teddy's Lab consists
                    of a 200g Danish beef smash burger on a homemade bun with double cheddar, bacon, and Teddy sauce. It
                    was one of the best smash burgers I've ever had. The bun is soft, but doesn't get soggy. The patty
                    is that perfect fresh grilled burger flavor, and it is tender without being chewy or fatty. The
                    Teddy sauce is amazing, but I have absolutely no clue what is in it or even a guess as to what it
                    could be. The sauce's flavor works so well with the cheese and bacon that it is honestly nearly
                    impossible to separate it out in order to describe its flavor in my opinion. It was amazing and I
                    will definitely be going back.</p>

                <p>I decided to be a bit more adventurous for lunch and was not disappointed. This dish consisted of
                    fried squid, fried prawns, a couple fried baby octopus (which the menu did not mention), and some
                    lettuce to pretty it up. The fried calamari was amazing. The greasiness perfectly complemented the
                    flavor making what tasted like a slightly chewier and fishier chicken ring. The prawns were also
                    pretty good. They were full without the intestines removed, so that was a little off putting, but
                    the taste was still superb and identical to any fried shrimp. Finally, the octopus was not my cup of
                    tea. The tentacles were simply too chewy and slimy when you swallowed for me. Plus, I was getting
                    full anyways. Overall, it made for a decent lunch and I'm glad I ventured out even if I don't intend
                    to eat it again.</p>

                <p>I did not expect to have one of the best burritos I've ever eaten in Italy, but I did. This dish was
                    cheese, basmati rice, jalapenos, black beans, and BBQ pulled pork all wrapped up in a tortilla. It
                    looked and smelt amazing and, luckily, it also had a taste to match. The way the cheese seemed to
                    allow the rest of the ingredients to melt in your mouth, while not overtalking all of the other
                    flavors was simply perfect. Each bite you could individually taste each ingredient, but they also
                    came together to form the perfect Tex-Mex meal. The BBQ on the pork was slightly tangy which only
                    further helped this burrito. I will definitely have this meal again before I leave.</p>

                <p>As you probably can't tell from the picture, this was an extremely good smash burger. It was 2
                    patties with cheese, bacon, fries, mayo, and Donts sauce. As you can probably tell since this food
                    journal is turning into a burger journal, the burgers in Italy are amazing, and this is no
                    exception. The sweet mayo pairs perfectly with the tangy Donts sauce. The fries gave a softness that
                    paired with the bacon's crunchiness. Then the cheese with the smash burger gave the classic fresh
                    grilled cheeseburger taste. Every ingredient had a match, making an amazing burger. It smelt like
                    any cheeseburger would, but the offsetting fries and bacon caused the texture to seem as if neither
                    was there at times despite being able to taste them. Overall, an amazing experience and if Teddy's
                    Lab wasn't better, faster, and cheaper; I would go here more often.</p>

                    does not show up on Google Maps, Apple Maps, or the Italian Business Registry. The chicken nuggets
                    themselves were fine. They were the typical microwaved, precooked chicken nuggets. These had been
                    sitting out, so they were cold, however, the nuggets were one of about 4 things they would let us
                    order. The name I have listed isn't the name because the B stands for something. If you want to find

                <p>If you expect me to say that this burger was amazing, you are correct. The burger consisted of a 160g
                    patty with lettuce, tomato, onion rings, and BBQ sauce. I also added a second patty and bacon to
                    mine. It was a pretty typical BBQ bacon burger. The BBQ was tangy, the bacon was crispy, and the
                    patties were tender and medium. It smelt like BBQ and was a bit difficult to hold and bite, but the
                    experience was amazing. Plus the lady running the place (all by herself) was extremely nice and even
                    brought us a roll of paper towels to dry off with since we had just came in out of a thunderstorm.
                    Overall, an amazing experience and burger. If I am ever near Vatican City again, I may stop back in.

                    description would be a hotdog pizza. It wasn't bad. The crust was soft, but a little burnt on the
                    edges. The cheese covered the pizza. The sauce and toppings did not slide off the pizza like many do
